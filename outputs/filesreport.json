It relies on the external libraries numpy and math for mathematical operations. The ALU module, located in the internal library Arquitectura, contains the main functionality of the ALU. It includes classes and functions for performing arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, etc. The module provides methods that handle the input and output of data, as well as methods for setting and retrieving the ALU's internal state. Overall, the ALU.py file serves as a crucial component for executing arithmetic and logical operations in a computer system."
