It also depends on internal modules for each operation: Sum, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Power, and IntDivide. Additionally, the Calculator class depends on the internal dependency ALU. However, the project has a high level of cohesion because the files within the Operations directory have a clear and specific purpose related to arithmetic operations. Each file represents a different operation and they all inherit from the Operation class, which provides a blueprint for implementing the 'calculate' method. This high cohesion indicates that the code is well-organized and focused on a single responsibility, making it easier to understand, maintain, and modify."
