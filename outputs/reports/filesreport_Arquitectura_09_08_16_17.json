The Calculator class in the 'Calculator.py' file also imports the ALU class from the internal library 'ALU'. However, the project has a high level of cohesion because the files within the 'Operations' package have a clear and specific purpose of implementing mathematical operations. Each file represents a specific operation and contains classes that inherit from the Operation class. This modular and organized approach enhances code readability and maintainability."
