It imports various external libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, os, sys, json, re, and string. It also imports internal libraries such as Operations.Sum, Operations.Subtract, Operations.Multiply, Operations.Divide, Operations.Power, Operations.IntDivide, and Puta.mierda. The ALU class has methods for initializing the ALU, performing calculations, processing operands, and processing operators.", "gid": 0}
