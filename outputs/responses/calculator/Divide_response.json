{"dependencies": ["int#Operation"], "explanation": "This file contains a class called 'Divide' that inherits from the 'Operation' class. The 'Divide' class has an initializer method that takes two float parameters and calls the initializer of the parent class. It also has a 'calculate' method that checks if the second parameter is zero and raises a ValueError if it is. Otherwise, it returns the result of dividing the first parameter by the second parameter.", "gid": 2}
