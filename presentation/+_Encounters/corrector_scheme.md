- The corrector scheme follows the [predictor_scheme](predictor_scheme.md) in an iterative process.
- It refines the initial prediction made by the [predictor_scheme](predictor_scheme.md).
= The corrector scheme uses more accurate computations and error correction techniques to adjust the predicted value.
- It compares the predicted value with a more precise estimation or reference value to determine the adjustments needed.
- The corrector scheme aims to improve the accuracy and convergence of the iterative process by reducing errors.
