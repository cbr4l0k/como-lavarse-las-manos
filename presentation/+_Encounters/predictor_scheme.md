- The predictor scheme is the initial step in an iterative process.
- It estimates the next value or state based on the current information and the known behavior of the system.
- The predictor scheme uses simple calculations or extrapolation techniques to make a prediction for the next iteration.
- It is a forward-looking step that provides an initial approximation for the iterative process.
